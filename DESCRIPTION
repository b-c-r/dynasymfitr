Description: This package hosts functions to estimate the strength of
    density-dependent symbiotic species interactions as part of the DFG-funded
    research unit 5726, DynaSym (https://www.dynasym.uni-konstanz.de/). The
    research unit aims at combining laboratory experiments and ecological
    theory, which requires sophisticated statistical methods, including the
    combination of numerical simulations of population models with maximum
    likelihood estimators or Bayesian MCMC parameter estimation. The package
    will include functions to fit, e.g., several functional response models or
    nutrient uptake models while correcting for inferring processes such as
    resource growth or consumer death that would otherwise harm precise
    parameter estimation.
